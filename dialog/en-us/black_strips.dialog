The regularly spaced gaps near the equator are due to lack of coverage between orbits. Terra, Aqua and Aura are polar orbiting satellites, traveling from pole to pole. The Terra satellite travels north to south. Aqua and Aura move in the opposite direction, south to north. At high latitudes, adjacent imaging swaths overlap significantly but at the equator gaps occur between adjacent swaths. As a result, complete global coverage is achieved every one to two days.
